# Retail-Management-System

## Project Overview
**Project Title:** Jackdaniel's Men’s Wear – Excel-Based Retail Management System 

**Tool Used:** Microsoft Excel  
**Domain:** Retail / Apparel  

This project implements an **Excel-based retail management system** for a men’s wear shop that previously **lacked structured stock, billing, and profit management**. The solution simplified daily operations and enabled the shop to **avoid stock-outs, control inventory effectively, and improve overall profitability**.

The dataset covers **3 months of operations (Oct 1 – Dec 31, 2025)**.

---

## Business Problem

The shop faced common retail challenges:  

- No proper stock tracking → frequent out-of-stock situations  
- No clear view of daily profit  
- Cash and UPI collections were hard to reconcile at day-end  
- Sales data existed but was not actionable  

These gaps directly affected sales and profit.

---

## Solution Provided

This Excel system was designed to:  

- Maintain **accurate stock availability**, ensuring products are not sold out unexpectedly  
- Track **daily sales and profit** clearly  
- Separate and summarize **cash and UPI collections** for easy daily counting  
- Provide a **daily sales overview**, allowing the owner to know exact business performance for each day  

As a result, the shop could **manage inventory better and increase profitability**.

## Project Structure (High-Level)

- Product Master  
- Stock Availability  
- Sales Entry  
- Bill Summary (Pivot-based)  
- Exchange / Return  
- Sales Overview (Daily KPIs)

---

## Key Features

- Real-time stock tracking to prevent out-of-stock issues  
- Daily profit calculation  
- Clear cash vs UPI collection summary  
- Bill-wise and product-wise sales tracking  
- Simple design tailored for non-technical retail users

## Additional Benefits

 **Error Reduction in Daily Operations**  
Because sales, stock, billing, and returns are connected across sheets, the shop avoids:  
- Double entry mistakes  
- Manual total calculation errors  
- Mismatch between sold quantity and stock  

This directly improves data accuracy, which most small shops struggle with.

 **Faster End-of-Day Closing**  
With the Sales Overview sheet:  
- Cash and UPI amounts are automatically summarized  
- Daily cash count and UPI count are visible  
- Profit is known without manual calculation  

This reduces day-end closing time and mental effort.

 **Better Restocking Decisions**  
Stock availability and status clearly indicate:  
- Fast-moving items  
- Sizes or categories needing refilling  
- Slow-moving items  

This prevents overstocking and dead inventory, not just stock-outs.

 **Clear Separation of Operations vs Analysis**  
The design intentionally separates:  
- **Sales Entry** → operational data  
- **Bill Summary / Overview** → analytical view  

This ensures system stability even as daily data grows.

 **Handles Real Retail Complexity**  
The system supports:  
- Partial cash + UPI payments  
- Default and special discounts  
- Exchanges and returns  

It reflects real-world retail operations, not just textbook examples.

 **Scalable Without Changing Logic**  
Even though it’s Excel:  
- More months and products can be added  
- Existing formulas and pivots continue to work seamlessly  

This demonstrates solid system design.

 **Owner Independence**  
After setup:  
- The owner can operate without daily external help  
- No additional software costs  
- No technical training required  

This provides huge value for small businesses.

 **Strong Portfolio Signal**  
From a data perspective, this project showcases:  
- Business understanding  
- Data modeling in Excel  
- Practical profit calculation logic  
- End-to-end system thinking  

Much stronger than a generic “Excel project.”
